**Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm**
Usage: `Find if cycle existed in a list node`
Remark: `according to Floyd's cycle detection algorithm, when both pointers move at the same speed, they will eventually meet at the starting point of the cycle.`

Example:

```
1. LeetCode/Linked_List_Cycle.py
1. LeetCode/Find_the_Duplicate_Number.py
```
